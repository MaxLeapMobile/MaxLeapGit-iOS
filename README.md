## Support
* GitMaster is an Open Source project on Github. Star and Pull requests are welcome!
  https://github.com/MaxLeapMobile/MaxLeapGit-iOS

## Requirements
* Require at least iOS 8.0.

* Integrate frameworks: run "pod install".

* Authentication:
  GitMaster supports two variants of OAuth2 for signing in. You will need to register your OAuth application, and provide GitMaster with your client ID, client secret and callback URL in PrefixHeader.pch file before trying to authenticate: 
```objective-c
  #define kGitHub_Client_ID CONFIGURE(@"GitHub_Client_ID") 
  #define KGitHub_Client_Secret CONFIGURE(@"GitHub_Client_Secret")
  #define kGitHub_Redirect_URL CONFIGURE(@"GitHub_Redirect_URL")
```

Please Note:
To facilitate both iOS and Android versions of GitMaster, we took advantage of the powerful computing ability and high efficiency of our 
[MaxLeap CloudCode service](https://maxleap.com/en_us/guide/usermanual/cloudcode.html) to realize the logic of GitHub projects recommendations. The part of "Recommendation" in this project, therefore, is not runnable at the moment due to the confidentiality of MaxLeap-related keys. We will optimize this part and make it available in the near future. To learn more about MaxLeap CloudCode, please refer to: https://maxleap.com/en_us/guide/devguide/java.html.
