  "body": "Bug occurs on Firefox 40.0.3 (and some previous versions from memory). Does not occur on IE11. Both tested on Windows 8.1.\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Open a new browser tab. (This seems to be an important step.)\r\n1. Go to http://theguardian.com by typing it directly into the location box.\r\n1. Click on a link on the home page. Today I chose http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/aug/31/serena-williams-best-because-brains-not-body\r\n1. Notice the browser's Back/Forward buttons are displaying correctly: Only Back is active; there is no Forward button.\r\n1. Click the browser's Back button.\r\n1. Then...\r\n  * What actually happens: The page doesn't change at all. But the browser's Forward button becomes active.\r\n  * What should happen: The page should go back to the home page.\r\n\r\nOnce we've got to that point we can then continue to find more weirdness:\r\n\r\n1. Click on another link. I chose http://www.theguardian.com/sport/serena-williams\r\n1. Click the Back button again.\r\n1. Then...\r\n  * What actually happens: The page goes back to the original article (good!) but the now the browser's Forward button is not active.\r\n  * What should have happened: The page should indeed have gone back to the original article, but the browser's Forward button should be active."
